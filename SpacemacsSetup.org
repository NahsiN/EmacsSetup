How to install Spacemacs on Ubuntu 17.10. 
Remove your .emacs.d and .emacs from your home directory (back them up).
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
Run emacs
1. What is your preferred editing style? Choose (emacs)
2. What distribution of spacemacs, would you like to start with? Choose (spacemacs)
3. What type of completion framework do you want? Choose (helm)
It will now connect to elpa and downloading a bunch of emacs packages. This is the good part. You don't
have to search anymore and configure them.
You will have to remove elpa Debian packages for this to work
sudo apt remove elpa-zenburn-theme elpa-yasnippet elpa-solarized-theme org-moe elpa-org elpa-org-bullets elpa-monokai-theme elpa-markdown-mode elpa-ivy elpa-dash elpa-dash-functional elpa-company
